# Cowin-Dashboard

This project has been implemented using webscraping and python. It will fetch the data from the site "https://www.mygov.in/corona-data/covid19-statewise-status/" and will show a graphical and tabular representation of the data as number of total confirmed cases, deceased cases, and active cases of the last 24 hrs.
